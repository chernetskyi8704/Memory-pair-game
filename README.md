# Memory â€“ Pair Game

## Project Overview

This project was aimed at the practical application of the acquired knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS. The task was to create the Memory-Pair Game - a card game in which all the cards are placed face down on the surface, and two cards are turned over each time. The goal of the game is to find pairs of matching cards. The game ends when the last pair is matched.

## What did the project give me?

This project became a good practice not only for improving my professional skills, but also allowed me to build an action plan on my own, as well as identify the main tasks and subtasks that I need to solve to implement it. In my project, I used for loop, various array methods such as map and forEach, as well as asynchronous setTimeout functions that allowed me to customize the game process.
